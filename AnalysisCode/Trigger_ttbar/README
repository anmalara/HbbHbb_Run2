1) Produce skimmed ttree using TE_presel.C

2) Produce turn-on using DoTurnOnXJ, where
    X=Q for Quad Jet Trigger
    X=D for Double Jet Trigger
    X=A for Quad&&Double Trigger

    This produces fitterFunction*.h, the efficiency is then produced using trig.h

3) Produce closure plots using clos_XJ.cc, where
    X=Q for Quad Jet Trigger
    X=D for Double Jet Trigger
    X=C for Quad&&Double Trigger  
    X=A for Quad||Double Trigger  

4) Compare in signal using ../Hbb_Trigger.cc, change path to trig.h in the header to data/ttbar accordingly
