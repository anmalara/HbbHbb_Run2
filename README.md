<h1> Resonant Higgs pair production in LHC Run II </h1>

Following the discovery of a Higgs boson at the CERN LHC with mass around 125 GeV and properties so far consistent with the Standard Model of particle physics, it has become important to search for new resonances that decay into pairs of such Higgs bosons. While non-resonant pair production of the Higgs boson is allowed in the SM, the theoretical production cross section is approximately 10 fb and well beyond the sensitivity of currently acquired data. However, several well-motivated hypotheses of physics beyond the standard model posit narrow-width resonances that decay into pairs of Higgs bosons, and could be produced with large enough cross sections to be probed with existing data. The radion and Kaluza--Klein gravitons in the  Randall--Sundrum model of warped extra dimensions are examples of such resonances.

This is the analysis suite used to perform a model-independent search for the resonant pair production of Higgs bosons. Data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and recorded by the CMS experiment at collision energy of 13 TeV is used. We perform this search for the case where both Higgs bosons decay into bottom quark-antiquark pairs.
