Observed Limit: r < 0.0213
Expected  2.5%: r < 0.0108
Expected 16.0%: r < 0.0150
Expected 50.0%: r < 0.0210
Expected 84.0%: r < 0.0314
Expected 97.5%: r < 0.0448
>>> including systematics
Will use a-priori expected background instead of a-posteriori one.
>>> method used to compute upper limit is Asymptotic
>>> random number generator seed is 123456
Computing limit starting from expected outcome
Will compute both limit(s) using minimizer Minuit2 with strategy 0 and tolerance 0.01
