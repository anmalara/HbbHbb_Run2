Observed Limit: r < 0.0466
Expected  2.5%: r < 0.0243
Expected 16.0%: r < 0.0329
Expected 50.0%: r < 0.0464
Expected 84.0%: r < 0.0682
Expected 97.5%: r < 0.0969

>>> including systematics
Will use a-priori expected background instead of a-posteriori one.
>>> method used to compute upper limit is Asymptotic
>>> random number generator seed is 123456
Computing limit starting from expected outcome
Will compute both limit(s) using minimizer Minuit2 with strategy 0 and tolerance 0.01
